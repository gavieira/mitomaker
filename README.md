# mitomaker

Alex Schomaker's (***in memoriam***) pipeline for mitochondrial genome assembly.

Available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/mitomaker/. 

**This code was not written by me!** 

This is being hosted here to be used as a quick reference in my own projects and learning process, since Alex's code is very well-written and legible.
